# Node SVMP Proxy

Serves as a basic TCP proxy between Android devices and Android VMs running in the cloud. Handles authentication, session management, and proxying messages.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* Install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) 2.2 or newer

### Install Steps
1. Download this project
2. Within the root directory of this project, run this command to install the project and download dependencies:

        $ npm install

### Configuration

1. Create a file named *config/config-local.js* using *config/config-local.js.example* as a template.  Please
read through the comments on config-local.js.example for a description of the fields
2. Review the various fields in *config/config-local.js* and set them to match your configuration

#### Enable TLS

If you don't have your own CA and you want to use TLS, follow these steps to generate a CA certificate, server certificate, and server private key:

1. Make sure you have the Java JDK installed
2. Open the *utils/generate_tls.sh* script and change the preset passwords for the CA, server, and client keys:

        # Change these variables
        CA_PKEY_PASS="changeme_cakeypass"
        SERVER_PKEY_PASS="changeme_serverkeypass"
        CLIENT_PKEY_PASS="changeme_clientkeypass"

3. Open the *tls/ca.cnf*, *tls/server.cnf*, and *tls/client.cnf* files  and configure them to your liking
4. Run the script from the root directory of the project to generate certificates in the *out* directory:

        $ ./utils/generate_tls.sh

5. In *config/config-local.js*, set the `tls_certificate`, `tls_private_key`, and `tls_private_key_pass` values to match your server certificate, private key, and password

#### Using client certificate authentication
If you want to use client certificate authentication, follow the **Enable TLS** instructions, then:

1. In *config/config-local.js*, set the `tls_ca_cert` value to match your CA certificate, and set the `use_tls_user_auth` value to *true*
2. Copy the client certificate *.p12* file to your device (Note: Android 4.0+ required)
3. To install the client certificate, open the SVMP client, create a new connection, choose an *Auth Type* of *Certificate*, touch the *Certificate* button, and use the KeyChain system to install the certificate

### Running the Proxy Server

1. Start MongoDB
2. Start the proxy:

        $ node proxy.js

### Adding Users and VMs

* Run the commandline client from the root directory of the project:

        $ ./bin/spm -h

    Run the help command to see a list of all commands
